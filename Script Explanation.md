# ☣️ Lesson on the Ransomware.py script

1. **Importing Libraries:**  

   - Imports standard Python libraries like `os`, `random`, `string`, `hashlib`, `base64`, `requests`, `shutil`, `threading`, and `subprocess`. These libraries are used for performing operations on the operating system, generating random numbers, manipulating strings, making HTTP requests, among other functionalities.

---

2. **Class `AdvancedRansomware`:**  
   - Defines a class called `AdvancedRansomware`, which encapsulates all the functionalities of the ransomware.

---

3. **Initialization:**  

   - In the `__init__` method, it sets the initial configurations of the ransomware, such as generating an encryption key, the target directory for encrypting files, the email address for contact, and backup extensions.
---

4. **Method `generate_key`:**  

   - Generates a random encryption key.

---

5. **Method `encrypt_file`:**  

   - Encrypts a file using the AES algorithm in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode with a strong key. The original file is deleted after encryption.

---

6. **Method `send_encryption_key`:**  

   - Sends the encryption key to a server on the dark web (simulated). It uses Tor to anonymize the communication.

---

7. **Method `delete_backups`:**  

   - Attempts to delete backups from the system using advanced evasion techniques.

---

8. **Method `exploit_vulnerability`:**  

   - Simulates exploiting a vulnerability, such as EternalBlue, to gain privileged access to the system.

---

9. **Method `ransomware_attack`:**  

   - Calls the `encrypt_file` method to encrypt a specific file.

---

10. **Method `propagate`:**  

    - Simulates the propagation of the ransomware to other systems using advanced self-replication techniques.

---

11. **Method `create_ransom_note`:**  

    - Creates a ransom note file (`README.txt`) in the target directory, providing instructions to the user on how to pay the ransom.

---

12. **Method `execute`:**  

    - Calls all the previous methods to execute the full ransomware attack.

---

13. **Example Usage:**  

    - Creates an instance of the `AdvancedRansomware` class and starts its execution in a new thread.

This script is an educational simulation of ransomware, intended to teach about cybersecurity, vulnerability exploitation, and attack prevention. It's important to emphasize that the use of such techniques on real systems without consent is illegal and unethical. The educational purpose of this script should be strictly respected.
